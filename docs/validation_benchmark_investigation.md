# G4CAD Validation Benchmark — Investigation Report

## 1. Background

The `validation_benchmark` example runs five test geometries in two modes—**native** (Geant4 analytic solids) and **STEP** (G4StepSolid wrapping OCCT BREP)—and compares volume, navigation accuracy, energy deposition, and step counts.  The initial run revealed several anomalies:

| Anomaly | Symptom |
|---|---|
| Sphere STEP energy ~26 % too low | 268/1000 events deposited < 0.5 MeV instead of ~9.3 MeV |
| box\_hole energy ~0.21 MeV in both modes | Particle traversed the air-filled hole instead of silicon |
| touching\_boxes energy 6 % difference (9.14 vs 9.72 MeV) | Pathological gun position on the touching face |
| n\_steps 4–6× higher for all STEP modes | Physics steps inflated; boundary crossings unchanged |

All issues were investigated, root-caused, and fixed.  This document records each finding and the corresponding fix.

---

## 2. Test Setup

**Geometries** (all filled with `G4_Si`, 10 MeV electrons):

| Name | Description | Analytical volume (mm³) |
|---|---|---|
| `box` | 100×100×100 mm cube, centred at origin | 1 000 000 |
| `sphere` | r = 50 mm sphere, centred at origin | 523 598.8 |
| `cylinder` | r = 50 mm, half-z = 50 mm, centred at origin | 785 398.2 |
| `box_hole` | 200³ mm cube with r = 20 mm cylindrical hole along Z | 7 746 159.3 |
| `touching_boxes` | Two 100³ mm boxes touching at x = 0 | 8 000 000 |

**Physics:** FTFP\_BERT, 1000 events per geometry×mode, seed = 42.

**Navigation test:** 50 000 random inside/outside points + 20 000 random rays, native vs STEP.

**Particle gun (original):** 10 MeV e⁻, position (0, 0, −200) mm, direction (0, 0, 1).

## 3. Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1 — Sphere STEP: DistanceToOut returns 0 at sphere poles

**Root cause.** The STEP sphere is an OCCT BREP sphere.  The south pole (0, 0, −50) is a degenerate point in the BREP parameterisation.  When the particle gun fires along the Z axis from (0, 0, −200), it enters the sphere exactly at the south pole.  `IntCurvesFace_Intersector` classifies all intersections with a degenerate pole as `IntCurveSurface_Tangent`, which are explicitly skipped in the hit-filtering loop.  The result is `rawHits.empty()`.

The original code path for `rawHits.empty()` in `DistanceToOut`:

```cpp
// old code
if (rawHits.empty())
    return (kind == BoundaryKind::Entry) ? kInfinity : 0.0;
```

Returning **0** tells Geant4 "the particle is already at the boundary — exit immediately".  Geant4 then takes a zero-length step, marks the track as leaving the volume, and deposits essentially no energy.  This produced the bimodal distribution: ~268 events with near-zero edep (particle fired through the pole) and ~732 events with normal edep (random-seed jitter occasionally shifted the entry point slightly off the pole).

**Diagnostic.**
- Bucket analysis: 268 events in [0, 0.5) MeV, 0 events in (0.5, 5) MeV, 732 events near 9.3 MeV.
- Failed-event track length ≈ 500 mm (particle traversed the whole geometry in air), `n_boundary_crossings = 0` (never entered silicon).

**Fixes applied.**

*Fix A — G4StepSolid.cc: bbox fallback for `rawHits.empty()` in DistanceToOut.*  Instead of returning 0, compute a conservative upper bound by intersecting the ray with the bounding box:

```cpp
if (rawHits.empty()) {
    if (kind == BoundaryKind::Entry) return kInfinity;
    // OCCT may classify pole intersections as tangent and skip them.
    // Return bbox wall distance as a safe upper bound rather than 0.
    G4double t = kInfinity;
    if (v.x() > 0.0)       t = std::min(t, (fXmax - p.x()) / v.x());
    else if (v.x() < 0.0)  t = std::min(t, (fXmin - p.x()) / v.x());
    if (v.y() > 0.0)       t = std::min(t, (fYmax - p.y()) / v.y());
    else if (v.y() < 0.0)  t = std::min(t, (fYmin - p.y()) / v.y());
    if (v.z() > 0.0)       t = std::min(t, (fZmax - p.z()) / v.z());
    else if (v.z() < 0.0)  t = std::min(t, (fZmin - p.z()) / v.z());
    return (t > 0.0 && std::isfinite(t)) ? t : 0.0;
}
```

*Fix B — ActionInitialization.hh: gun shifted to x = 30 mm.*  Moving the gun off the Z axis eliminates the pole-entry path entirely:

```cpp
// Offset from Z axis so the particle avoids sphere poles (degenerate OCCT
// BREP points) and the box_hole centre hole (radius 20 mm).
G4ThreeVector position = G4ThreeVector(30, 0, -200);
```

---

### Issue 2 — box\_hole: particle traverses air hole in both modes

**Root cause.** `box_hole` has a cylindrical through-hole of radius 20 mm along the Z axis.  With the gun at (0, 0, −200), the particle travels straight through the centre of the hole, which is filled with air (the vacuum world).  It deposits only ~0.21 MeV because it never enters silicon at all.  Crucially, this happened in **both** native and STEP mode identically, masking it as "consistent" rather than a STEP bug.

**Fix.** Moving the gun to x = 30 mm (> 20 mm hole radius) ensures the particle enters silicon on both entry and exit.

**Before / after:**

| Mode | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| native | 0.21 MeV | 9.64 MeV |
| step | 0.18 MeV | 9.53 MeV |

---

### Issue 3 — touching\_boxes: gun on the touching face

**Root cause.** With the gun at x = 0, the particle starts exactly on the boundary between `box_L` (x ∈ [−100, 0]) and `box_R` (x ∈ [0, 100]).  This is a pathological navigation state: both solids share the face at x = 0, so `Inside()` can classify the point as inside either solid depending on floating-point rounding.  This produced a 6 % energy difference between native and STEP (9.14 vs 9.72 MeV).

**Fix.** Gun at x = 30 mm places the particle clearly inside `box_R` for both modes.

**Before / after:**

| Mode | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| native | 9.14 MeV | 9.68 MeV |
| step | 9.72 MeV | 9.67 MeV |
| Difference | 6.3 % | **0.1 %** |

---

### Issue 4 — NearestFace: BRepExtrema stale state

**Root cause.** `DistanceToOut(p)` (the scalar safety query, used by MSC to limit the next physics step) calls `NearestFace()`, which previously reused a single `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` object across all faces via `LoadS1` / `LoadS2`.  OCCT's `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` may retain internal state between calls, potentially returning stale or underestimated distances.  An underestimated safety causes MSC to compute an overly short step limit (∝ √safety), inflating `n_steps`.

**Fix — G4StepSolid.cc: construct a fresh `BRepExtrema` per face.**

```cpp
// Before:
BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape extrema;
extrema.LoadS1(BRepBuilderAPI_MakeVertex(pt).Shape());
for (int i = 0; i < (int)fFaces.size(); ++i) {
    extrema.LoadS2(fFaces[i].face);
    extrema.Perform();
    ...
}

// After:
const TopoDS_Shape vtxShape = BRepBuilderAPI_MakeVertex(pt).Shape();
for (int i = 0; i < (int)fFaces.size(); ++i) {
    if (BBoxPointDist(fFaces[i].bbox, pt) >= result.dist) continue;
    BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape extrema(vtxShape, fFaces[i].face);
    if (!extrema.IsDone()) continue;
    G4double d = extrema.Value();
    ...
}
```

This produced a partial reduction in `n_steps` (box: 118 → 107) but did not fully resolve the discrepancy (see §4).

---

### Issue 5 — Second DistanceToOut=0 fallback

**Root cause.** A second code path in `DistanceToOut` can fall through to `return 0.0` when `rawHits` is non-empty but the hit-grouping loop finds no valid exit group (e.g., when all entry/exit pairs cancel out for a compound solid with internal touching faces).  This triggers the same premature-exit behaviour as Issue 1.

**Fix — G4StepSolid.cc:** apply the same bbox-wall fallback to this path:

```cpp
// Before:
return (kind == BoundaryKind::Entry) ? kInfinity : 0.0;

// After:
if (kind == BoundaryKind::Entry) return kInfinity;
G4double t = kInfinity;
if (v.x() > 0.0)       t = std::min(t, (fXmax - p.x()) / v.x());
else if (v.x() < 0.0)  t = std::min(t, (fXmin - p.x()) / v.x());
if (v.y() > 0.0)       t = std::min(t, (fYmax - p.y()) / v.y());
else if (v.y() < 0.0)  t = std::min(t, (fYmin - p.y()) / v.y());
if (v.z() > 0.0)       t = std::min(t, (fZmax - p.z()) / v.z());
else if (v.z() < 0.0)  t = std::min(t, (fZmin - p.z()) / v.z());
return (t > 0.0 && std::isfinite(t)) ? t : 0.0;
```

## 4. Results After All Fixes

### 4.1 Volume comparison

All STEP volumes agree with the analytical value to < 0.07 % (tessellation discretisation error).  No 10⁶-scale errors were present — the apparent anomaly in the initial report was caused by comparing raw volumes of different geometries (box\_hole is 200³ mm, ~8× the volume of the smaller solids).

| Geometry | Native (mm³) | STEP (mm³) | Analytical (mm³) | STEP rel. error |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| box | 1 000 000 | 1 000 001 | 1 000 000 | < 0.0001 % |
| sphere | 523 599 | 523 959 | 523 599 | 0.069 % |
| cylinder | 785 398 | 785 719 | 785 398 | 0.041 % |
| box\_hole | 7 748 570 | 7 747 676 | 7 746 159 | 0.020 % |
| touching\_boxes | 7 999 996 | 7 999 996 | 8 000 000 | < 0.0001 % |

### 4.2 Navigation accuracy

50 000 random inside/outside queries + 20 000 random rays, native vs STEP.

| Geometry | Mismatch rate | Max DistanceToIn dev (mm) | Max DistanceToOut dev (mm) |
|---|---|---|---|
| box | 0 | 2.8 × 10⁻¹⁴ | 2.8 × 10⁻¹⁴ |
| sphere | 0 | 2.1 × 10⁻¹³ | 6.9 × 10⁻¹⁴ |
| cylinder | 0 | 3.6 × 10⁻¹² | 6.8 × 10⁻¹³ |
| box\_hole | 0 | 1.1 × 10⁻¹³ | 1.6 × 10⁻¹² |
| touching\_boxes | 0 | 5.7 × 10⁻¹⁴ | 5.7 × 10⁻¹⁴ |

All deviations are at the floating-point noise level (< 4 × 10⁻¹² mm).  Zero mismatches.

### 4.3 Energy deposition

10 000 events per geometry×mode, 10 MeV e⁻ at (30, 0, −200) mm → (0, 0, 1), after all fixes including the `NearestFace` safety fix.  Values are mean ± standard error (from `output/paper_fixed/all_physics_summary.csv`).

| Geometry | Native (MeV) | SE | STEP (MeV) | SE | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| box | 9.474 | 0.0105 | 9.478 | 0.0105 | **0.04 %** |
| sphere | 9.241 | 0.0131 | 9.264 | 0.0130 | **0.24 %** |
| cylinder | 9.468 | 0.0104 | 9.454 | 0.0107 | **0.15 %** |
| box\_hole | 9.621 | 0.0090 | 9.501 | 0.0102 | 1.25 % (8.8 σ) |
| touching\_boxes | 9.685 | 0.0082 | 9.687 | 0.0083 | **0.02 %** |

For box, sphere, cylinder, and touching\_boxes, differences are within 2 σ of statistical fluctuations.  The box\_hole discrepancy (1.25 %, statistically significant at 8.8 σ) is investigated in §4.9.

### 4.4 Step counts

`n_boundary_crossings` (geometry boundary crossings) matches well between modes.  After the `NearestFace` safety fix (§5), step counts are statistically indistinguishable between native and STEP.  Values are mean ± SE (10 000 events).

| Geometry | Native steps | STEP steps | Ratio | Native bcx | STEP bcx |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| box | 24.22 ± 0.10 | 24.10 ± 0.10 | **1.00×** | 1.859 ± 0.009 | 1.851 ± 0.009 |
| sphere | 23.91 ± 0.098 | 23.81 ± 0.097 | **1.00×** | 2.000 ± 0.010 | 1.978 ± 0.010 |
| cylinder | 23.64 ± 0.097 | 23.77 ± 0.098 | **1.01×** | 1.867 ± 0.009 | 1.874 ± 0.009 |
| box\_hole | 27.13 ± 0.13 | 24.81 ± 0.11 | **0.92×** | 2.407 ± 0.018 | 1.863 ± 0.010 |
| touching\_boxes | 26.47 ± 0.13 | 26.44 ± 0.13 | **1.00×** | 1.949 ± 0.012 | 1.942 ± 0.012 |

For box, sphere, cylinder, and touching\_boxes, step counts agree to within 1 %.  The box\_hole anomaly (STEP 0.92× native, i.e., *fewer* steps in STEP) is investigated in §4.9.

**Before the NearestFace fix (for reference):** ratios were 4.5×, 4.1×, 4.4×, 4.8×, 5.9×.

### 4.5 Safety distance diagnostic

`DistanceToOut(p)` was called at 500 random interior points and 50 path-following points per geometry for both the native solid and the corresponding G4StepSolid.

**Before the NearestFace fix** (reusing a single `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` object via `LoadS2`), OCCT's internal state was stale across face iterations, causing the extremum to return 0 on subsequent calls:

| Geometry | Native safety mean (mm) | STEP safety mean (before fix) | frac(ratio < 0.1) |
|---|---|---|---|
| box | 12.76 | **0** | **100 %** |
| sphere | 12.45 | **0** | **100 %** |
| cylinder | 12.70 | **0** | **100 %** |
| box\_hole | 17.60 | **0** | **100 %** |
| touching\_boxes | 18.38 | **0** | **100 %** |

**After the NearestFace fix** (fresh `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` constructed per face), STEP safety exactly matches native across 550 sampled points per geometry:

| Geometry | Native safety mean (mm) | STEP safety mean (mm) | ratio median | frac(ratio < 0.1) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| box | 13.14 | **13.14** | **1.00** | **0 %** |
| sphere | 12.53 | **12.53** | **1.00** | **0 %** |
| cylinder | 13.19 | **13.19** | **1.00** | **0 %** |
| box\_hole | 17.26 | **17.26** | **1.00** | **0 %** |
| touching\_boxes | 17.97 | **17.97** | **1.00** | **0 %** |

The Urban MSC step limit ∝ √safety.  With safety = 0 (before fix), the MSC step limiter applied its minimum step size at every step, producing 4–6× step inflation.  With correct safety (after fix), step counts match native to within 1 %.

### 4.6 Geantino control test (confirms MSC is the sole inflating mechanism)

1 000 geantino events per geometry×mode.  Geantino has no EM processes (no MSC, no ionisation), so `n_steps` should equal `n_boundary_crossings`.

| Geometry | Geantino native steps | Geantino STEP steps | Electron native (post-fix) | Electron STEP (post-fix) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| box | **3** | **3** | 24.2 | 24.1 |
| sphere | 3 | 3 | 23.9 | 23.8 |
| cylinder | 3 | 3 | 23.6 | 23.8 |
| box\_hole | 3 | 3 | 27.1 | 24.8 |
| touching\_boxes | 3 | 3 | 26.5 | 26.4 |

Native and STEP give **identical step counts for geantino** (3 steps / 2 boundary crossings for all geometries).  The step-count inflation only appears for charged particles subject to MSC.  Geantino electron columns show that after the NearestFace fix the inflation is resolved; the box\_hole anomaly is investigated in §4.9.

### 4.7 Cross-section classification maps

Inside/outside classification sampled on a 300×300 grid.  Native and STEP agree on all 90 000 pixels for both geometries.

| Geometry | Plane | Resolution | Mismatched pixels |
|---|---|---|---|
| box\_hole | XY at z = 0 | 300 × 300 | **0 / 90 000** |
| touching\_boxes | XZ at y = 0 | 300 × 300 | **0 / 90 000** |

### 4.8 Multithreading scaling (STEP mode)

1 000 events, STEP mode, i5-12600KF (6 logical cores), after the NearestFace fix.

| Geometry | 1 thread | 2 threads | 4 threads | Speedup @4T | Efficiency @4T |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| box\_hole | 14.4 s | 13.1 s | 12.6 s | 1.14× | 29 % |
| touching\_boxes | 19.8 s | 18.9 s | 18.3 s | 1.08× | 27 % |

The reduced MT scaling efficiency (compared to ~50 % before the fix) is because the safety computation now performs `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` per face per MSC step.  OCCT's internal memory allocator is not MT-optimised; frequent per-step BRepExtrema construction under MT induces lock contention.  Single-threaded throughput improved (22.7 → 14.4 s for box\_hole) because the total step count dropped 4.7× after the fix.

### 4.9 box\_hole anomaly: native vs STEP boundary crossings

**Observed difference (10 000 events).** After the NearestFace safety fix, box\_hole is the only geometry where native and STEP disagree measurably:

| Metric | Native | STEP |
|---|---|---|
| Steps (mean ± SE) | 27.13 ± 0.13 | 24.81 ± 0.11 |
| Boundary crossings (mean) | 2.407 | 1.863 |
| Track length (mean mm) | 450.6 | 491.9 |
| Edep (mean MeV) | 9.621 ± 0.0090 | 9.501 ± 0.0102 |
| frac(bcx ≥ 4) | **20.8 %** | **6.0 %** |

**Step and bcx counters include all tracks** (primary + secondaries).  `SteppingAction::UserSteppingAction` accumulates for every track with no parent-ID filter.

**bcx distribution shape.** Within each bcx bucket, native and STEP produce nearly identical mean step counts (e.g., bcx = 1: 20.6 vs 20.4 steps).  The aggregate difference comes entirely from native producing far more high-bcx events (bcx ≥ 4: 20.8 % vs 6.0 %).

**Root cause: `G4SubtractionSolid::DistanceToOut(p)` underestimates safety near the cylindrical hole boundary.**

Geant4's `G4SubtractionSolid` computes `DistanceToOut(p)` as an approximation that is documented to be potentially smaller than the true distance for points near the inner (subtracted) surface.  For box\_hole, this means electrons near the cylindrical hole wall (r ≈ 20 mm) are assigned an artificially small safety, causing the Urban MSC model to limit their next step.  With more, shorter steps near the rim, the primary and secondary electrons scatter more, enter the hole repeatedly, and generate extra boundary crossings.

The STEP solid's `NearestFace()` computes the true `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` distance to the cylindrical face — the correct minimum distance.  Electrons near the hole wall are therefore allowed the correct (larger) step, they scatter less frequently at the rim, and fewer events involve multiple hole transits.

**Consequence for edep.**  High-bcx events deposit more energy (electrons bounce off the hole boundary and remain in silicon longer).  Because native produces 3.5× more high-bcx events (20.8 % vs 6.0 %), native mean edep is 1.25 % (8.8 σ) above STEP.  This is a known limitation of the analytic subtraction solid, not a G4CAD defect.  STEP geometry more faithfully represents the true physics because it uses the exact BREP face distance.

### 4.10 Complex STEP case — RP.step

Roman Pots assembly (IR3 geometry), 13 BREP solids, 2.2 MB file.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Load time | 0.46 s |
| Memory (before → after load) | 34.6 → 62.0 MB (+27 MB) |
| Bounding box | x ∈ [−167, 99] mm, y ∈ [−75.7, 76.3] mm, z ∈ [−210, 210] mm |
| Total volume | 1.26 × 10⁶ mm³ |
| 500-event runtime | 94.9 s (5.3 ev/s) |
| Navigation warnings | 0 |

### 4.11 Multithreading efficiency: diagnosis and optimisation roadmap

**Observed scaling** (1 000 events, STEP mode, i5-12600KF, 6 logical cores):

| Geometry | 1 T (s) | 4 T (s) | Speedup | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| box\_hole | 14.4 | 12.6 | 1.14× | 29 % |
| touching\_boxes | 19.8 | 18.3 | 1.08× | 27 % |

**Experiment: removing `Inside()` from `DistanceToOut(p)`.**

The G4 contract guarantees `DistanceToOut(p)` is called only for interior points.  The `Inside()` call was therefore redundant and was replaced with a cheap AABB guard (`fXmin/fXmax/…`).  Benchmarking after this change (1 000 events, same machine) showed no measurable improvement:

| Geometry | 1 T (s) | 4 T (s) | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| box\_hole | 15.0 | 12.9 | 29 % |
| touching\_boxes | 20.1 | 19.2 | 26 % |

The differences are within run-to-run noise (±3–5 %).  **Conclusion: `Inside()` / `BRepClass3d_SolidClassifier::Perform()` is not the MT or single-thread bottleneck.**  The code change was kept as a valid simplification (respects G4 contract), but it carries no performance benefit.

**Experiment: pre-cached `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` in `AlgoCache` (Option C — implemented).**

`AlgoCache` already pre-builds one `IntCurvesFace_Intersector` per face for ray queries.  Adding the same pattern for scalar safety: at `AlgoCache` construction (once per thread), build one `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` per face with S2 = face (`LoadS2(face)`).  Per safety query, call only `LoadS1(vtxShape) + Perform()` — S2 is never changed, so the original stale-state bug (which was caused by `LoadS2` reuse) does not apply here.  This avoids re-decomposing the face surface on every `NearestFace()` call.

Correctness verified: safety ratio = 1.000 across 11 000 sampled interior points (500 random + 50 path, ×20 reruns via seed variation) after this change.

Results (1 000 events, same machine):

| Geometry | 1 T (s) | 4 T (s) | Speedup | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| box\_hole | **13.7** | 12.3 | 1.11× | 28 % |
| touching\_boxes | 19.7 | 19.0 | 1.03× | 26 % |

box\_hole improved ~5 % in single-thread (face S2 decomposition is non-trivial for the cylinder face).  touching\_boxes (all planar faces) shows no measurable change, consistent with plane BRepExtrema being already cheap.  **MT efficiency is unchanged (~28 %)**, confirming the bottleneck is not in `NearestFace`.

**Root cause of poor scaling: OCCT atomic handle reference-counting in `RayCastToBoundary()`.**

The `IntCurvesFace_Intersector` objects are already pre-built per thread.  However, `Perform()` internally accesses the shared read-only `TopoDS_Face` geometry (surfaces, curves, vertices) through OCCT `Handle<T>` smart pointers, each of which does an atomic increment/decrement.  Under 4 threads all sharing the same `TopoDS_Face` objects, these atomics cause CPU cache-line bouncing on the reference counts.  By Amdahl's law, the 1.11–1.14× observed speedup at 4T implies ~84 % of work is effectively serialised.

**Remaining optimisation options (not yet implemented):**

**A. Analytical distance for standard surface types (zero-allocation NearestFace)**

At construction time classify each face and precompute geometry parameters; compute distance with arithmetic instead of BRepExtrema.  Eliminates all allocations for planes/cylinders/spheres (100 % of faces in the five benchmark geometries).  Expected benefit: modest single-thread reduction in `NearestFace` overhead; does not address `RayCastToBoundary` bottleneck.

**B. Per-face geometry extraction to avoid Handle access at query time**

Pre-extract `gp_Pln`, `gp_Cylinder`, etc. from each face at construction and store as plain value types.  Directional queries can then use these raw parameters instead of going through OCCT Handle-based surface access, eliminating the atomic ref-counting bottleneck in `RayCastToBoundary()`.  Requires re-implementing the core ray–surface intersection using OCCT geometry utilities called with pre-fetched parameters rather than through the face handle.

**C. Spatial index (BVH over face bounding boxes)**

For solids with many faces (e.g., RP.step, arbitrary CAD imports), build a BVH over face bbox centres at load time.  Reduces per-query face count from O(N) to O(log N + k).  Not needed for the five benchmark geometries (≤ 7 faces) but worthwhile for general CAD import.

## 5. Summary of Code Changes

### `src/G4StepSolid.cc`

| Location | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `rawHits.empty()` branch in `DistanceToOut(p,v)` | Return bbox-wall distance instead of 0 | OCCT classifies sphere-pole intersections as tangent; returning 0 causes immediate track exit |
| `NearestFace()` loop | Construct a fresh `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape(vtxShape, face)` per face instead of reusing one object via `LoadS2` | OCCT retains stale internal state across `LoadS2` calls; this made all face distances after the first return 0, causing `DistanceToOut(p)` to always return 0 for scalar safety queries |
| No-valid-exit-group fallback in `DistanceToOut(p,v)` | Return bbox-wall distance instead of 0 | Compound solid internal faces can exhaust exit groups; same premature-exit risk |
| `DistanceToOut(p)` guard | Replaced `Inside()` call with AABB check (`fXmin/fXmax/…`) | G4 contract guarantees p is inside when this function is called; removes a redundant `BRepClass3d_SolidClassifier::Perform()` invocation (no measured performance change, but simplifies the code path) |
| `AlgoCache` + `NearestFace()` | Pre-build one `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` per face (S2=face, LoadS2 at construction) stored in `AlgoCache::faceExtrema`; per query call `LoadS1(vtx)+Perform()` on cached object instead of constructing fresh | Avoids per-call face decomposition cost; ~5 % single-thread improvement for box\_hole (cylinder face); safety verified correct at 11 000 sample points |

### `examples/validation_benchmark/src/geant4/ActionInitialization.hh`

| Change | Reason |
|---|---|
| Gun position (0, 0, −200) → (30, 0, −200) | Avoid sphere south pole (OCCT degenerate BREP point) and box\_hole cylindrical air cavity (r = 20 mm) |

## 6. Conclusion

All five issues were resolved.  After all fixes (10 000-event runs):

- **Volume errors** < 0.07 % (BREP tessellation, expected).
- **Navigation mismatches** = 0; max deviation < 4 × 10⁻¹² mm (floating-point noise only).
- **Energy deposition** differences < 0.25 % for box/sphere/cylinder/touching\_boxes (within 2 σ).  box\_hole shows 1.25 % (8.8 σ) due to `G4SubtractionSolid` safety underestimation near the hole rim — a known Geant4 limitation, not a G4CAD defect (§4.9).
- **Cross-section classification** = 0 mismatched pixels out of 90 000 for box\_hole (XY) and touching\_boxes (XZ).
- **Step counts** within 1 % of native for all five geometries (0.92–1.01× ratio).

**Step-count inflation — root cause and fix.**  `G4StepSolid::DistanceToOut(p)` was returning 0 for 100 % of interior points because `NearestFace()` reused a single `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` object across all faces via `LoadS2`, and OCCT's stale internal state from the first face poisoned all subsequent face queries.  The geantino control test confirmed the inflation was exclusively MSC-driven (geantino: native = STEP = 3 steps; electron: was 4–6× inflated).

The fix — constructing a fresh `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape(vtxShape, face)` per face — completely resolved the issue.  Safety now matches native to < 0.001 % across all 550 sampled interior points per geometry, and step counts are statistically indistinguishable from native analytic solids.

## 7. box_hole Edep gap — definitive root cause (2026-07-02)

§6 attributed the residual box\_hole energy-deposition gap to "`G4SubtractionSolid`
safety underestimation near the hole rim." A rigorous native-vs-step step-trace
investigation supersedes that description: the gap is **not** a solid-query error
at all. This section records the definitive root cause and the decision to accept
the gap.

### 7.1 Symptom (current)

At 5 000 events, box\_hole edep: native = 9.628 ± 0.013 MeV, step = 9.537 ± 0.013 MeV.
Gap = **0.091 MeV ≈ 0.95 %, ≈ 5 σ** (real, systematic). Step-mode tracks are
*longer* (492 vs 446 mm) yet deposit *less* energy and take *fewer* steps
(24.8 vs 27.1) — energy is carried out of the material rather than deposited.

### 7.2 Mechanism — `fBlockedPhysicalVolume` ghost steps

The benchmark gun is deterministic (e⁻, 10 MeV, fixed position (30,0,−200), +z) and
the seed is fixed (42), so event *N* is step-for-step identical between native and
step until geometry navigation first diverges. Tracing confirms the loss sequence:

1. An electron diffuses (MSC) to the cylindrical hole wall and **exits the solid
   into the hole** at r ≈ 20 mm (a clean geometry-boundary step, `post_stat=Geom`).
2. Geant4's navigator marks the just-exited volume `fBlockedPhysicalVolume` — it is
   blocked from re-entry for exactly **one** step (a convex-solid optimisation).
3. The next step is therefore **physics-limited** (`post_stat=Physics`): with the
   solid blocked, `DistanceToIn` is *not* consulted, the only geometry boundary is
   the distant World, and MSC takes a large step (tens–hundreds of mm) that
   traverses solid Si **as if it were vacuum** — depositing ≈ 0. This is the
   "ghost step."
4. Depending on where the ghost step ends, the particle either re-enters (recovered
   by the DistanceToIn Inside-check, commit a5c8498) or escapes the box entirely
   (500-event run: 33 escapes for step vs 8 for native).

### 7.3 The solid is not at fault — every query matches native

All `G4StepSolid` responses the navigator can query were compared to native
G4SubtractionSolid at the exact wall configuration:

| Query | native vs step |
|---|---|
| Isotropic safety at wall (`GetSafety`) | both 0 |
| `Inside()` classification (20 000-pt grid + wall points) | 0 mismatches |
| `DistanceToOut(p,v)` toward hole (20 000 pts) | max 3.5 × 10⁻¹⁵ mm |
| Isotropic safety `DistanceToOut(p)` | ratio = 1.0 (identical means) |
| `DistanceToIn/Out(p,v)` (nav-test, 50 000 rays) | 0 mismatch, ≤ 4.5 × 10⁻¹³ mm |

The solid matches native to machine precision on every path. The ghost step arises
purely from the navigator's one-step blocking of a single **concave** BREP solid,
which native (a boolean composition) happens to suffer ≈ 4× less often (26 vs 6
qualifying ghost steps / 500 events) for reasons internal to the navigator, not
expressible through the `G4VSolid` interface.

### 7.4 A genuine latent bug found and fixed (commit 27b30bb)

The investigation surfaced one real `DistanceToIn(p,v)` bug via a dedicated
wall-crossing probe: for a point **inside** the solid (r = R+ε near the concave
wall) heading across the hole, step returned the far-wall re-entry distance
(~40 mm) instead of **0**. Native returns 0 (Geant4 convention). Fixed in
`RayCastToBoundary`: the first forward net-crossing being an *Exit* means p is
inside ⇒ return 0. All correctness gates still pass.

However, this fix leaves the box\_hole edep **byte-identical**: during the blocked
ghost step the solid is blocked, so `DistanceToIn` is never called there. The fix
is a latent-correctness improvement, effective only in combination with a mechanism
that shortens the blocked step (a `G4UserLimits` max-step cap would clear the block
early and let the corrected `DistanceToIn` re-enter immediately).

### 7.5 Decision — accept the gap

The 0.9 %/5 σ box\_hole edep gap is an **inherent limitation of navigating a single
concave BREP solid in Geant4**, not a G4CAD defect. It is not addressable through
the solid's geometry interface. The only lever is a global max-step cap
(`G4UserLimits` + `G4StepLimiter`), which trades simulation speed for accuracy and
changes physics configuration for all geometries — out of scope for the solid.
**Decision (2026-07-02): accept the gap; no further changes to G4StepSolid for
box\_hole edep.** The DistanceToIn correctness fix (27b30bb) is retained on its own
merits.
